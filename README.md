# Zonaprop Rental Listings Scraper

This project is a Python-based web scraper designed to extract detailed information from rental property listings on Zonaprop. The scraper gathers data such as prices, expenses, descriptions, addresses, and images, and stores it in a structured CSV file for further analysis.

## Project Overview

- **Prices** and **Expenses** of the rental properties.
- **Property Address** and **Description**.
- **Images** associated with the listings.
- **Features** such as services, rooms, and other characteristics.

The final output is saved in a CSV file, making it easy to analyze the collected data.
